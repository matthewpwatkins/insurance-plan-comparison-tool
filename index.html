    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h4>Why do you need to know my marginal tax rate?</h4>
    <p>
      FSA and HSA contributions are tax-deductible, meaning that you can subtract them from your taxable income. For example, if you have a 25%
      tax rate and contribute $5,000 of your money to an HSA, you'll pay $1,250 less in taxes this year. Win!
    </p>

    <h4>How much does this assume I'm contributing to my HSA/FSA?</h4>
    <p>
      This tool assumes you are maximizing your tax exemptions by contributing the max amount to your HSA/FSA, taking into account
      legal limits for the upcoming year and any employer contributions. I could add a field for you to input your own contribution amount,
      but it would be complicated to add, and may not have a sizable impact on the results. If you plan to contribute less than the max,
      you can subtract your contribution amounts and tax savings from the the total cost of each plan.
    </p>

    <h4>This tool doesn't show the hundreds of thousands of dollars an HSA can save me over the years!</h4>
    <p>
      Good for you, you understand the power of compound interest! Yes, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn6FtTZYeWE">HSAs have
      several superpowers</a> that aren't accounted for in this tool:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>First superpower: You keep the money and you use it whenever you want.</b> <i>FSAs</i> (the kind you get with the PPO plan)
      are "use it or lose it" -- if you don't spend the money by the end of the year, you've just made a generous contribution to the FSA plan administrator.
      But HSAs are truly yours forever, and you can use them for any medical expenses, past, present, or future, even when you're no longer on DMBA's plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Second superpower: Investment.</b> FSAs sit in a cash account and earn no interest. So technically, the money you put in an FSA is slowly evaporating
      to inflation over the course of the year. But HSAs usually live in a brokerage account, where cash by itself can often earn enough interest to outpace inflation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even better, you can invest your HSA in index funds, where it can grow 8-10% on average. This is <i>incredibly</i>
      powerful. If you're in your early 20s, you can expect each $1,000 you invest in your HSA today to grow to <i>$88,000</i> by the time you retire.
      That's not a typo-- that's the power of compound interest!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Third superpower: Triple tax advantage!</b> Like FSAs, HSAs are tax-deductible on the front-end. But they also grow tax-free, and are tax-free
      on withdrawal for medical expenses. HSA is the best parts of an FSA plus the best parts of a Roth IRA combined!
