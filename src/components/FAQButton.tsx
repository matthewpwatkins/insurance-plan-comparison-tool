        <div>
          <p>Your marginal tax rate is the rate at which your last dollar of income is taxed. It's the sum of your federal and state marginal tax rates.</p>
          <p><strong>To find yours:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Check your last tax return for your tax bracket</li>
            <li>Add your state income tax rate</li>
            <li>Use online tax calculators for estimates</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Common combined rates:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>22% federal + 5% state = 27% total</li>
            <li>24% federal + 6% state = 30% total</li>
            <li>32% federal + 7% state = 39% total</li>

          </ul>
          <p><strong>Common cost estimates:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Primary care visit: $200-300</li>
